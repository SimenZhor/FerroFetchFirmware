# FerroFetchFirmware
Firmware for the Applied Procrastination "Fetch" ferrofluid display

Currently almost everything in here is under development and no hardware project should be based on this firmware as it is in it's current state. Things will change.


## PlatformIO
The code has been developed and used in the PlatformIO environment, which is recommended to be used with VSCode (Atom also works).
For more information: https://platformio.org/install
